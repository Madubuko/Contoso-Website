# Contoso-Website

This project is a fully functioning website with interactive features for a fictional company - Contoso News.

I completed it as part of the "Microsoft -  DEV211.1x: Introduction to HTML and JavaScript" online course, that I took on edX.

I completed the course in March 2017, and you can view my Verified Certificate for the course here: https://courses.edx.org/certificates/9293b657cf8c40589ea27252920abac4
